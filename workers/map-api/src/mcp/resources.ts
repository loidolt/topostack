TopoStack turns real terrain into laser-cutter files. Files are generated and exported in the TopoStack studio in the browser; these tools plan a model and hand it over as a studio link.

## Layered or flat

- **layered** (default): a stack of cut sheets that rebuilds the terrain in 3D. Each sheet covers one band of elevation; lakes can be carved below the shoreline. Good for plywood, MDF, acrylic, cardboard.
- **flat**: one sheet engraved with contour lines, roads, water and labels. Nothing is stacked; set how many contours with \`contourCount\` (${PROJECT_REQUEST_LIMITS.contourCount.min}–${PROJECT_REQUEST_LIMITS.contourCount.max}).

## What decides the number of sheets

The layer count is never set directly. The model's width over the ground width fixes the horizontal scale; the terrain's relief at that scale, times \`verticalExaggeration\`, gives the stack height; and \`materialThicknessMm\` divides it into whole sheets (at least two).

- Thicker material: fewer, coarser sheets.
- More exaggeration or a wider model: taller stack, more sheets.
- A smaller area on the same model size: larger scale, taller relief, more sheets.

Typical materials: 3 mm plywood or MDF, 1.5–3 mm acrylic, 2 mm chipboard. Many hobby lasers cut 3 mm comfortably. Big mountains at small scales can need 40+ sheets; if a plan says so, suggest thicker material, less exaggeration, or a smaller model.

## Size and the laser bed

\`widthMm\` × \`heightMm\` is the finished model (default 300 × 200 mm). If it is larger than the laser's bed, set \`laser.workAreaWidthMm\` and \`laser.workAreaHeightMm\`: each sheet is split into pieces with alignment tabs. \`laser.kerfMm\` (default 0.15) compensates for the beam width.

## Choosing the area

- \`{ center: { lat, lon }, widthKm }\`: a place and how much ground to show across. A single mountain is often 10–30 km; a lake 5–40 km; a city 15–30 km.
- \`{ bounds: { west, south, east, north } }\`: keep a whole box in view; it is widened to the model's proportions.

Coverage is Web Mercator (±85° latitude). A box crossing the antimeridian has west greater than east, as in GeoJSON. Terrain is land elevation; the sea is cut flat, and lakes use surveyed depths where they exist (see check_coverage).

## Details

Water, water depth, roads, trails, elevation labels, a north arrow and a scale bar are on by default; road labels, boundaries and a coordinate grid are off. In the United States, \`aviation\` adds FAA detail like a VFR sectional's: \`airspace\` (Class B, C and D), \`specialUse\`, \`runways\`, \`airports\`, \`navaids\`, \`obstacles\` and \`labels\` (identifiers and airspace altitudes), all off unless set. It is decorative and never for navigation; check_coverage says whether an area has it. A \`title\` of up to three lines is engraved on the model; \`markers\` add up to ${PROJECT_REQUEST_LIMITS.markers} engraved points of interest.

\`airspaceStack\` builds the Class B, C and special use airspace (and optionally Class D lids) over a layered US model in acrylic, at true height on the model's own vertical scale, held on rods the maker cuts to length; like the aviation detail, it is decorative and never for navigation. Choose \`form\`: \`plates\` (each level cut to all the airspace at that height; sturdy), \`tiers\` (only the shelves, the wedding cake; least acrylic) or \`volumes\` (solid, and acrylic-hungry); plates and tiers differ most where special use areas span several levels. \`tint\` is \`clear\` or \`chart\` (blue and magenta acrylic); by default plates are clear and the others chart. A whole Class B needs a 100–160 km area and about 10× \`verticalExaggeration\` before its shelves separate; plan_model estimates the height, and \`ceilingCapFt\` keeps it practical. \`false\` turns it off.

## Handing over

Share the studio link. Opening it generates the model; the user checks the 3D preview, then chooses Export for per-sheet SVG files, a master layout, an assembly guide, and ATTRIBUTION.txt. Output is decorative, not survey-grade.
