# scripts

Operational tooling, grouped by purpose. `lib/` holds shared helpers (among them `pinned-download.mjs` for sha256-pinned source files, `hash.mjs`, `main-module.mjs` for scripts that are also libraries, and `app-url.mjs`), `test/` the Node tests (`npm run test:scripts`), and `data/` the source catalogs that the app, the Worker, and these scripts all read.

Scripts that drive the studio in a browser read its address from `TOPOSTACK_APP_URL`, defaulting to the dev server `npm run dev` starts (`http://localhost:5273`, or `TOPOSTACK_WEB_PORT`). The older per-script variables (`SURVEY_TEST_APP_URL`, `CHART_STRESS_URL`, `TOPOSTACK_CAPTURE_URL` and others) still work. Deployment checks keep `PUBLIC_APP_URL` and `WORKER_URL`, which CI sets.

Every script below says how it is run. "manual" means no npm script or workflow invokes it; the linked runbook does.

## Build steps (`build/`)

Run by `npm run build` in the generator or by CI after a build.

| Script | Purpose | Run by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `check-node.mjs` | Fail fast when the local Node.js release cannot run the script tests (needs native type stripping) | `npm run test:scripts` |
| `build-font-glyphs.mjs` | Convert the curated typefaces in `assets/fonts/` into the studio's glyph files and picker samples ([fonts.md](../docs/fonts.md)); `font-glyphs.test.mjs` fails when the committed output is stale | manual |
| `build-locator-data.mjs` | Build `apps/generator/src/lib/site/locator-data.json`, the Natural Earth map data behind the locator on each lake page, clipped to the area around the directory's lakes ([seo-operations.md](../docs/seo-operations.md)) | manual, when the lake directory reaches a new area |
| `check-web-budget.mjs` | Measure the built site against the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML budgets | `npm run budget:web` |
| `check-worker-bundle.mjs` | Hold the map-api Worker script to its gzip budget and fail when geometry code (clipper, contour tracing, generation, export) reaches it; reads the dry-run build in `workers/map-api/dist/` | `npm run budget:worker` (CI `build-and-budget`) |
| `configure-redirects.mjs` | Apply the Cloudflare redirect rules (www and legacy paths) to the zone | manual: [seo-operations.md](../docs/seo-operations.md), [development.md](../docs/development.md) |
| `finalize-static-headers.mjs` | Rewrite `_headers` for the selected site environment after a build | generator `build`; generator `build:e2e` |
| `generate-icons.mjs` | Regenerate favicons and app icons from `static/favicon.svg` | `npm run assets:icons` |
| `lock-lake-slugs.mjs` | Append a URL slug for every lake that newly qualifies for its own `/lake/<slug>` page to `apps/generator/src/lib/site/lake-slugs.json`; existing slugs never change ([seo-operations.md](../docs/seo-operations.md)) | manual, after a lake directory change; `lake-places.test.ts` fails until it has run |
| `prune-atomm-dist.mjs` | Drop the public site's images and example files from an Atomm build; no-op for other environments | generator `build` |
| `write-markdown-pages.mjs` | Write a Markdown twin (`index.md`, `guides/<slug>.md`, …) beside every prerendered site page, from its `<main>`, for the Worker's `Accept: text/markdown` negotiation; no-op for the Atomm build | generator `build`; generator `build:e2e` |
| `write-build-version.mjs` | Record git metadata for the About page in the built site | generator `build`; generator `build:e2e` |
| `write-third-party-licenses.mjs` | Write the licence notices for redistributed compiled code (the sheet-nesting engine) to `dist/licenses/third-party.txt` | generator `build`; generator `build:e2e` |
| `packages/nest-wasm/scripts/build.mjs` | Compile the sparrow nesting engine to WebAssembly into the committed `packages/nest-wasm/pkg/` (needs Rust, wasm-bindgen-cli and wasm-opt; see the [package README](../packages/nest-wasm/README.md)). With `--check`, it verifies `pkg/` was built from the current sources without needing Rust | `npm run build:nest-wasm` (manual); `--check` from the package `test` script; `nest-wasm.yml` workflow |

| `capture-social-cards.mjs` | Draw the 1200×630 sharing cards for guides, hubs and lake regions into `apps/generator/static/images/cards/` from pictures already in the repository and the lake directory (`node scripts/dev/capture-social-cards.mjs [name ...]`; Playwright Chromium only, no dev server); see [seo-operations.md](../docs/seo-operations.md). Card layout: `lib/social-card.mjs` | manual |
| `render-lake-previews.mjs` | Render the top-down depth map for lake pages (`--sample`, `--slugs a,b` or `--all`) from the map API's terrain and survey data into `.topostack/lake-previews/` with a review page; resumable, uploads nothing (needs `cwebp`); see [seo-operations.md](../docs/seo-operations.md) | manual |
| `dev.mjs` | Start the generator and the map-api Worker together, picking free ports | `npm run dev` |
